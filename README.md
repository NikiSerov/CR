# CR

## Description

**CR** is a small website created for my friend to quickly find an episode of his favorite series by title, since the videoplayer does not contain any episode titles.

It generates links to episodes, that lead to the video player page, where the chosen episode is selected.
You can choose from seasons and episodes or find an episode by typing its name in the search input.
